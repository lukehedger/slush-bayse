# slush-bayse

> [Slush](http://slushjs.github.io/) generator for [Bayse](https://github.com/lukehedger/bayse)

## Getting Started

### What is Slush?

The streaming scaffolding system. [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) as a replacement for [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/).

### Slush Generator

To install slush-bayse from npm, run:

```bash
$ npm install -g slush slush-bayse
```

Finally, initiate the generator - optionally adding the name of your app:

```bash
$ slush bayse <app-name>
```

You can customise your Bayse by answering the generator's questions. Once everything has been installed, just run `gulp` to compile your project and start your server.
